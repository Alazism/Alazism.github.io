          <hr>
          <p>"Kristen was super helpful and always knew how to answer my questions without giving me the answer. I also really found it helpful how she would lead me towards an answer but in the end I put all the pieces together to answer questions. I also found Kristen's enthusiasm for this class to be extremely beneficial, as she made me more excited about inorganic chemistry."</p>
          <hr>

          <hr>
          <p>"Kristen was an amazing teaching assistant, and I learned more from her than my professor. She is talented at teaching and truly cares about her student's wellbeing.

          <hr>
          <p>"She was a very good TA. Even though I didn't interact with her a lot (given that she was not my recitation leader) when she taught the class while the professor was absent she was very good. I wish she taught for us all the time!"</p>

          <hr>
          <p>"Kristen was an absolutely amazing TA and out of everyone, I definitely learned the most from her. She was able to break down the confusing topics in recitation and was very helpful (even when the recitation worksheets were unnecessarily confusing). I appreciated her exam reviews on the days we had exams and I think that I was able to do so well on the exams because of her. While structure of the class was poor and only served to stress students out with the large number of poll questions on concepts we didn't know and some exam questions that just felt like they were meant to trick us, Kristen was a big positive of the class for me and made me not dislike the class as much."</p>
          <hr>
          <p>"When she lectured, I liked how she explained every concept and lecture activity in depth to ensure we completely understood, and also she is very kind and patient when helping students in class."</p>

          <hr>
          <p>"She was a great instructor. Kristen was always willing to help even if she saw you were just struggling but didn't ask for help."</p>
          <hr>
          <p>"I have never had a TA like Kristen! Though I did not have her for recitation, she has constantly helped me during lecture and office hours to really help me understand the content. She went above and beyond to make the class review sheets for exams and make sure we did well. She was also encouraging and a positive light everyday."</p>
          <hr>
          <p>"Kristen was super helpful in class and never made me feel dumb for not knowing stuff. She was also very good at breaking stuff down and making it more understandable. She was also always very calm which was nice for a class early in the morning."</p>

          <hr>
          <p>"Kristen Aviles was another fantastic TA. She explained things so clearly and in a fun way. She was always so positive and never made you feel bad for asking a question."</p>
          <hr>
          <p>"She would never make a student feel as if they'd asked a stupid question, she was understanding and very helpful."</p>
          <hr>
          <p>"Kristen is very helpful and understanding. She listens really well and has empathy for students' struggles. She is also really good at explaining concepts."</p>
          <hr>
          <p>"Kristen was often encouraging us to take care of ourselves and it was always a needed reminder. She had the best recitation because she explained things thoroughly but in a comprehensible way. The review sheets she made taught me how to make my own and is something I have used in other classes as well."</p>
          <hr>

          <hr>
          <p>"Kristen is one of the best TAs I have gotten to learn from for any course. She is the most kind-hearted, patient, and knowledgeable people that I have ever had the privilege of learning from. When she took over teaching lecture, she did a great job and somehow made me less stressed out about the class. During office hours, she explains all concepts throughly and does so in a way that connects all content that I had been previously having trouble with."</p>

          <p>"Kristen was always willing to put in extra time and effort to help us with our assignments and ensure in-depth feedback on our writing. The weekend zoom hours, while I never made it, were very comforting to know that if I had an issue there was a time set aside. I also appreciated the amount of flexibility with due dates as it helped me feel understood especially when I have a lot of other classes and work to complete. The stickers and smiley faces on assignments are EXTREMELY important, they were always a highlight to get more stickers, and the smiley faces helped me feel like even if the grade was a little lower than I hoped, that she could tell I had put forth effort."</p>
          <hr>
          <p>"The instructor rewarded our hard work and provided positive, constructive criticism. I never stopped learning the entire semester, and regardless of how challenging things were, I was never daunted by the tasks at hand. I felt right at home the whole semester. Give this instructor a huge raise; they absolutely deserve it."</p>
          <hr>
          <p>"Kristen is kind and is always available to ask questions, which has allowed me to feel more comfortable with my writing in this course. As a result, I feel that I have developed a better understanding of the material and can apply it to my reports. The feedback I receive on my drafts is thorough and I feel that has helped the most with my improvements."</p>
          <hr>
          <p>"Kristen is well prepared during each class and always checks with each individual to ensure that they understand what is going on each lab. If a student is struggling with a concept, she will not hesitate to further explain and give examples. There had been a situation where the class had not understood a technique due to not taking any courses that went in-depth with it, so she provided supplementary information on the course page. It was helpful when reviewing data and allowed me to get a better understanding of how to write about it. I feel that my success in this course is mostly due to her ability to help students and provide excellent guidelines in the course."</p>
          <p>"Thanks to this instructor, my scientific writing skills have improved tenfold, and I have gained new confidence in my writing. Additionally, this course has provided me with the skills necessary to create plans and work through problems in chemistry from a technical standpoint, and at this point in the semester, do it all comfortably. The versatility of my skills in the lab has expanded more than I could imagine in such a short time."</p>
